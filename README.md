<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Train and test a multi layer network.

## What I learned from this project
* Implement a deep network from scratch
* Use of python libraries like numpy, matplotlib and tensorflow
* Better understanding of the theory of gradient descent and back propagation
* Implement a k-layer deep network from scratch, with batch noramlization and scale and shift.
* Better understanding of initialization of the parameter of network
* Coarse Search of hyperparameter like lambda
